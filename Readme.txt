Database conversions by Millennium Software

This program demonstrates how you can take a table from a database (MS Access only in this demo) and convert all the records in that table into an HTML document for viewing in a web browser, converting it into a comma delimited text file for viewing in any spreadsheet program and filling a listbox with data. I'm still working on one that will use SQL statements to get certain information, instead of the whole thing.

In order to make it work without errors, You MUST make a reference to the Microsoft DAO Library (This can be found by clicking the the PROJECT - REFERENCES menu, then scroll down the listbox until you see "Microsoft DAO 3.0 Library" (or higher)).

The database used in this demo is a database that comes with VB6 and is compatible with MS Access 97 and MS Access 2000 (it may need to be converted).

The code is well commented, and any questions can be directed to me (Sean Young) at: Y2KSftwr@aol.com

For more information (or code) on accessing databases with VB, feel free to contact me.
